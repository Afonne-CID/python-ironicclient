features:
  - Added a new ``ironic create`` command that creates resources (chassis,
    nodes, ports) specified in one or more JSON (``*.json``) or YAML
    (``*.yaml``) files. Similar to the ``ironic create`` command, the
    ``openstack baremetal create`` command creates resources specified in one
    or more files. (Note that ``openstack baremetal create`` can also be used
    to create a node via specified node attributes. However this feature is
    deprecated.)
