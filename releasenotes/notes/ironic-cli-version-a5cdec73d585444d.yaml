upgrade:
  - |
    The default API version for the ``ironic`` command is now "latest", which
    is the maximum version understood by both the client and the server.
    This change makes the CLI automatically pull in new features and changes
    (including potentially breaking), when talking to new servers.

    Scripts that rely on some specific API behavior should set the
    ``IRONIC_API_VERSION`` environment variable or use the
    ``--ironic-api-version`` CLI argument.

    .. note:: This change does not affect the Python API.
features:
  - |
    The ``ironic`` command now supports the specification of API version ``1``.
    The actual version used will be the maximum 1.x version understood by both
    the client and the server.  Thus, it is currently identical to the
    ``latest`` value.
fixes:
  - |
    Users of the ``ironic`` command no longer have to specify an explicit
    API version to use the latest features. The default API version is now
    "latest", which is the maximum version understood by both the client
    and the server.
