    When using ``--os-baremetal-api-version=latest``, the resulting API version
    is now the maximum API version supported by both the client and the server.
    Previously, the maximum API version supported by the client was used,
    which prevented ``--os-baremetal-api-version=latest`` from working with
    older servers.
