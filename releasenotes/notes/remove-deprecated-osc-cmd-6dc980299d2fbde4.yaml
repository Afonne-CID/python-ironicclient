upgrade:

    The following previously deprecated commands were removed:

    * ``openstack baremetal delete``
    * ``openstack baremetal list``
    * ``openstack baremetal show``
    * ``openstack baremetal set``
    * ``openstack baremetal unset``

    The equivalent commands are:

    * ``openstack baremetal node delete``
    * ``openstack baremetal node list``
    * ``openstack baremetal node show``
    * ``openstack baremetal node set``
    * ``openstack baremetal node unset``

    The support of creating a single node by ``openstack baremetal create``
    is removed, the equivalent command is ``openstack baremetal node create``.
    The only valid usage of ``openstack baremetal create`` now is to create
    various resources (chassis, node, port, portgroup, etc.) from resource
    file(s).
